                <p>Photography was an art form invented in the 1830s, although it didn't become publicly recognised until ten years later. Nowadays, photography is one of the largest growing hobbies in the world. It's hardware alone has created a multi-billion dollar industry. <br> Before photography was invented, people already knew the principles oh how it eventually got to work. People could process the image on the wall or on a piece of paper, however there was no way to print the image at the time. The instrument used to process the pictures was called the Camera Obscura. This is Latin for Dark Room. This was aorund for a few centuries before photography even came along. Camera Obscura is believed to have been invented around the 13-14th centuries.<br> Camera Obscura is essentially a dark, closed space in the shape of a box with a hole on one side. The hole has to be small enough to the box to make the camera obscura work properly. This works due to the light coming through the tiny holes transforms and creates an image on the surface.</p>

              <h4 class="card-title">The Invention of the Camera</h4>
              <p class="card-text">The first pinhole camera, also known as the Camera Obscura, was invented by Alhazen. (follow the link to learn more about Camera Obscura) In 1839, the Daguerreotype Camera was announced by the French Academy of Sciences. These are now one of the world's most expensive cameras. The Daguerreotype process was the first practicable method of making permanent images with a camera. It worked by producing images onto a silver-coated copper plate. In 1859, Thomas Sutton patented the panoramic camera, lense is made out of two hollow glass hemispheres. This was the first panoramic camera to use a wide-angle lense to capture a view wider than that of the human eye. In 1900 the first mass-marketed camera was invented, called the Brownie and was prsented by Eastman. This camera was on sale until the 1960's.The Brownie was a low-priced, point-and-shoot, hand-help camera, it was simple enough for children to use.</p>

              <h4 class="card-title">Portability of the Camera</h4>
              <p class="card-text">When cameras were first invented, they were very large and were not easy to move around. Not many people owned them, however those that did tended to keep them in one place. If they had to move them, they were very heavy and bulky. The Brownie (as mentioned previously) marked the start of camera truely being portable. It was a hand-held camera meaning it didn't require a tripod. As it was hand-held, it was considerably lighter and easier to move around. As more and more cameras were invented they got smaller and smaller as well as allowing for a clearer image. Nowadays, there are many variations of cameras which allows for the users to find one to suit their style. To help keep the size of cameras down, they have made lenses that can be changed and swapped. This allows the user to have more variations while still being able to use the same camera. These lenses can be kept in a camera bag, which keeps the camera easy to move around.</p>

              <h4 class="card-title">Lenses</h4>
              <p class="card-text">A good quality camera lense is essential for capturing sharo, detailed photots.  Lenses are made of glass or plastic, they focus kught rays by refracting or bending them so they meet or converge at a common point. A standard lense has a mid-range focal length, usually 50mm. They have an angle of view which is similar as the angle that the human eye can view. This means they create images which appear natural to the viewer. A Macro lense is designed specifically for close-up photography. They have different internal construction from normal lenses which gives them good sharpness and contrast. These produce eye-catching photos. Telephoto lenses have a long focal length and provide a high level of magnification. They are often bigger and heavier than other types of lenses. Wide angle lenses have a short focal length. These lenses provide an angle of view beyond what a standard lense produces. These allow more of the scene to be captured ina shot. </p>

              <h4 class="card-title">Photo Prints</h4>
              <p class="card-text">The first photo picture was taken in 2825 by a French Inventor called Joseph Niepce. (As shown above) The photo depicts a view from the window at Le Gras. While there is little merit in this photo, it is still the first photograph to be taken and preserved.There exposure for this photo had to last for eight hours, so the sun in the picture had time to move from east to west, appearing to shine on both sides of the building in the image. When film was used in cameras, as we all know we take them somewhere which specialises in developing that film. Origianlly, these were developed in a 'Dark Room', this is a slow process and it is impossible to see how the image turned out until it is finshed developing. Once technology has moved on, it meant that this film could be developed using a machine meaning the development was a lot faster. Once the Polaroid was invented, it would instantly print the images. Nowadays, you can simply walk into a supermarket, plug your device into a machine and print your photos instantly.  </p>
