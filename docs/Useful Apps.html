            <li class="list-group-item">
                <h5>Photoshop</h5>
                    <p>Photoshop is arguably the most known editing app. It allows you to create your own work exactly how you want. It doesn't limit you. It allows you to make significant changes to images while maintaining a high quality. The real power of Photoshop is in working with existing images. Typical tasks include treating and manipulation, compositing, converting to different formats, printing, etc. Photoshop is very strong in the world of printed media and is popular with newspapers and other publishers. Photoshop tends to work well with other applications. As well as integrating seamlessly with other Adobe products (such as Premiere, Illustrator, etc), Photoshop formats are also widely recognised and able to be imported into programs such as Macromedia Fireworks, Corel Draw, etc. Photoshop is so feature-rich that it does take a while to learn all the ins and outs. Don't expect to become proficient overnight. However the interface is well set out and quite intuitive. </p>    
            </li>
            
           <li class="list-group-item">
                <h5>Affinity Photo</h5>
                    <p>Affinity Photo is quickly becoming one of Photoshops biggest competitors. It offers many features which are either the same or similar to what Photoshop offers. The biggest selling point for Affinity Photo os that it's a one off price, not a monthly subscription like photoshop is. The latest version boasts plenty of amazing features, including full HDR merge support, 360-degree image editing, recordable macros and batch processing, plus a tone mapping workspace that enables you to turn any image – whether it’s a standard JPG or an HDR photo – into a dramatic scene, bringing out details you never realised were there.</p>    
            </li>
    
            <li class="list-group-item">
                <h5>PaintShop Pro </h5>
                    <p>PaintShop Pro has been the budget Photoshop alternative of choice on PC for over 20 years, and it's still holding its own. The new 2018 version promises to be easiest, faster and more creative than ever. It features ready-made project templates, a built-in screenshot function with a smart capture mode that lets you grab part of the screen, a gradient fill option and improved support for graphics tablets and styluses. PaintShop Pro is an excellent image editor that offers a full suite of powerful image editing, correction and drawing tools. The interface is extremely flexible, allowing you to customize it to match your exact requirements no matter what your main task is. Despite this powerful feature set, there still remains a lot of work to do in terms of optimization and overall response speed. Powerful and beautiful brush tools create a painterly experience, but it can be hard to finish a fluid brushstroke when the results are appearing well behind your cursor. For all but the most demanding users, Corel PaintShop Pro will provide all the image editing and creation features that they need. Professionals who are focused on speed and precision will be annoyed at the occasionally slow responsiveness, but this probably won't bother more casual users.  </p>
