            <li class="list-group-item">
                <h5>Simple Point and Shoot</h5>
                    <p>The majority of compacts are priced between £100-250. A number of these offer wideangle lenses, and practically all of them work on rechargeable lithium-ion batteries which are supplied with the camera. At the budget end of the scale the focus is decidedly on style, with slim and colourful bodies and an array of trendy features such as inbuilt Wi-Fi and face and smile detection included. More expensive models may incorporate longer zoom lenses and larger LCD screens, and may even offer touch-screen functionality.</p>    
            </li>
            
           <li class="list-group-item">
                <h5>Standard Compact Camera</h5>
                    <p>These are often priced between £100 - £250. A lot of these cameras offer wideangle lenses which allows for more of the scene to be captured in the shot. These cameras use a rechargable battery. More expensive models have longer zoom lenses and larger LCD screens. Many of these cameras offer some form of auto-intelligence, which automatically adjusts a number of settings according to the subject matter. This ideal for less confident users, who may be confused by certain settings. If it’s style and portability you’re after, Sony’s Cyber-shot range is a good place to look, as many models are either slim, colourful, packed full of technology, or all of the above, while the Canon IXUS range always tends to fare well, too. While such cameras are good general purpose models, they may put off larger-handed users or those used to the larger controls of an SLR. With the exception of touch-screen models, where control is through a series of virtual buttons on the LCD screen, the way these cameras operate is through an assortment of buttons and a menu pad on the rear. These can often be quite small and it may be difficult to see what you’re pressing, particularly as not all camera have these options clearly engraved.</p>

                <h5>Superzoom Bridge Cameras </h5>
                    <p>Superzoom cameras combine the flexibility of a wide focal range with a small format body. Many offer manual control over exposure (such as with an aperture or shutter priority option), and some allow you to manually focus too, meaning the photographer can take many decisions into their own hands. One crucial aspect of a superzoom camera is its image stabilisation system. When shooting at longer focal lengths a camera has to work harder to keep the image stable, which makes a lens or sensor based image stabilisation system vital. Some cameras only offer sensitivity-based image stabilisation systems which work by increasing the camera’s ISO – this is something best avoided if one of the alternative two solutions are available. Another popular feature on such models is an articulated LCD screen. These pull away from the body and allow you to shoot at awkward angles to the subject, such as at ground level. They may also help when shooting in bright conditions, as they can be adjusted to the angle with the least glare. The key aspect of a bridge camera is how far the zoom can reach. There are those which offer a more modest focal length, but in exchange offer a wide aperture, such as the Panasonic FZ200. On the other hand, there are those that offer huge focal ranges, such as the Nikon P900 with its incredible 83x zoom. </p>

                <h5>Interchangeable Lense Cameras </h5>
                    <p>While Compact System Cameras (or hybrids as they are sometimes known) have only been available for the past few years, they have significantly altered the photographic market. Some models use the same size of sensor found in DSLRs they are able to achieve a similar standard of image quality, where as others, such as the Pentax Q, use compact-sized sensors to reduce size even further. They can be made much smaller thanks to the lack of the traditional SLR mirror box. This does mean, however, that they cannot offer an optical viewfinder as standard – instead, some offer electronic viewfinders, while some simply have an LCD screen for composition. As a new and growing segment of the market, manufacturers are still building up lens options for these models. One of the advantages of these lenses is that, like the bodies on which they are mounted, they may be made smaller and lighter. For anyone wishing to travel light, a hybrid body with a couple of lenses may prove to be the best solution where image quality is key. As the first of these systems to enter the market, the Micro Four Thirds line has the most options at present, particularly as compatible lenses are being developed by both Olympus and Panasonic (as well as a few third-party manufacturers). Each of the major camera manufacturers offers at least one compact system camera, however only Sony currently offers a full-frame camera of this type.</p>

                <h5>DSLR Cameras</h5>
                    <p>DSLR cameras are what many people think of when it comes to advanced photography. Thanks to some serious strides in camera technology, it’s not necessarily true that DSLRs offer better image quality than CSCs, but it’s a different style of shooting that some prefer. Generally speaking, it’s still true that the widest range of lenses is available for DSLRs, meaning that the photographer may choose one that’s been developed specifically to suit their requirements. Most consumer DSLR cameras offer APS-C sensors, which are slightly larger than the Micro Four Thirds sensor but smaller than full-frame. This applies a conversion factor of around 1.5x to any mounted lens, which gives lenses a little extra reach. The downside of this is that wider angles are harder to achieve, and usually mean investing in either a full-frame body or a very wideangle lens which can tolerate some cropping. Full-frame cameras are starting to become more affordable as time goes on, with Nikon and Canon both offering “entry level, full-frame” cameras, like the Canon EOS 6D and the Nikon D610. DSLRs also have the widest range of accessories at present. A plethora of lenses aside, all DSLRs accept flashguns on their hotshoe, and many also take extra battery grips for extra power and easier shooting in the portrait orientation. With HD video now a staple feature on DSLRs, it’s even possible to invest in an external microphones for stereo sound recording, while the shallow depth of field offered by a larger sensor can be a great benefit with regards to creativity and low-light shooting.</p>
