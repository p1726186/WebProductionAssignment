              <p class="card-text">When taking photos, it is important to consider angle. Finding the right angle can be what makes or breaks your photo. Before going to a shoot, do a little research. This gives you an idea of what angles may be avaliable. Don't forget to move around! Try different locals, there may be better viewpoints. Be sure to look for unusual angles too. This may seen silly or a lot of effort for a photo but can be worth it. This can be something as simple as lying down or it could be climbing up something. Different heights gives you different perspectives.</p>

              <p class="card-text">When editing your photos, be sure to consider how obvious you want to it look. Most people want to ensure that their photo looks natural, and looking as though there's no editing involved. Every now and then, people like it to be obvious it's been edited. This allows for different effects. Just like the image above! If your editing to make it look natural, be sure to consider contrast. By increasing the contrast, it can make objects if your photos really pop.</p>

              <h4 class="card-title">Lighting</h4>
              <p class="card-text">Lighting is a key factor in photography.Any light originating from behind the camera, gives you very flat lighting. Lighting coming from the side, as it shows the shape of the subject and can create partial shadows, giving the photo a more interesting look. Light can be manopulated so that it falls on a particular area. This can be done through the use of reflectors. Relectors shape sunlight or bounce light onto the area you'd prefer to highlight.</p>

              <h4 class="card-title">Location</h4>
              <p class="card-text">Location can be very important when it comes to any photo. Different locations offer different lighting and shadows, allowing for different effects. If your shooting outdoors, try to avoid the midday sun. This is when it's brightest and can make your photos looked washed out. Outdoors is the best place for natural light, be sure to research your location before the shoot. You want a location which can offer you multiple views and lighting. An area which offers different varians is best as it allows you to shoot with different lighting.<br> </p>

        <h2 class="display-3 text-center">Tips & Tricks!</h2>
        <br>
        <ul class="list-group">
        <p class="lead">
            
            <li class="list-group-item">Before taking any photo, make sure your camera is focused rather than framing it first. A blurry picture is unuasble whereas one not precisely framed can still be saved. Therefore, you should always ensure that the image is focused before adjusting the frame.</li>
            
            <li class="list-group-item"> When photographing someone, be sure to focus on the eyes. We are always drawn to the eyes in a image as eyes are a natural focal point which we connect with. When taking portrait photographs, make sure the eyes are focused. As long as the eyes are focused, you and your subject are more likely to consider the picture to be properly shot.</li>
            
            <li class="list-group-item"> An important thing to remeber is the more mistakes you make, the more you learn and improve. All photographers started without understanding what really makes a good photo. The real value is in turning mistakes into lessons which builds your skills. So try a technique or style you haven't used before. </li>
            
            <li class="list-group-item">Always be ready. Keep your camera on one of the semi-auto or full automatic modes for those unxpected photo oppurtunities. You can always switch back to your preferred mode when you are shooting a stationary object. There may only be a split second to capture a great shot.</li>
            
            <li class="list-group-item">Camera shake can make a photo unusable. This can be prevented by increasing your ISO and opening up your aperture allows for quicker shutter speeds. However, this is not always an option if you're trying to maintain other specific qualities.</li>
            
            <li class="list-group-item">Keep both eyes open when looking through the rangefinder. When shooting portraits, your 'subject' will feel more comfortable if they can see one of your eyes open. If your eye was closed is can make many subjects feel uneasy.</li>
            
            <li class="list-group-item">Be sure to make use of reflections. There are a lot of unique opportunities of you pay attention where most people don't. Reflections gives you different lighting and allows for more variation when it comes to angles while still being able to focus on the subject. This will make your photos look more intriguing.</li>
